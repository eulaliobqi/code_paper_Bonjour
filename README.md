The spittlebug Mahanarva spectabilis (Distant, 1909) (Hemiptera: Cercopidae) is an important pest of forage grasses in South America, where its nymphs cause pasture damage by feeding on xylem sap and producing a characteristic foam that protects them against environmental stressors. To investigate the molecular basis of this adaptation, we integrated RNA-seq analysis of nymphs with LC–MS/MS proteomics of the Batelli gland, the primary source of foam secretion. De novo assembly of 100,666 unigenes revealed broad functional diversity, with strong representation of detoxification enzymes (CYP450s, GSTs, UGTs, carboxylesterases), transporters and ion pumps, cuticle proteins, and stress- and immunity-related genes. Nearly 16% of loci exhibited alternative splicing, particularly within detoxification, chemosensory, and osmoregulatory gene families, highlighting transcriptomic plasticity as a mechanism for ecological adaptation. SignalP/Phobius predictions identified 168 high-confidence secreted proteins, including detoxification enzymes, proteases, structural proteins, and immune factors, many of which are consistent with reported antimicrobial and surfactant activities of spittlebug foams. Proteomic profiling of the Batelli gland confirmed 500 proteins, enriched in chaperones, metabolic enzymes, detoxification pathways, and osmoregulatory components, with the most abundant proteins corresponding to Hsp70 chaperones, ATP synthases, cuticle proteins, and carbonic anhydrases. Together, these results provide the first integrative transcriptomic and proteomic framework for M. spectabilis nymphs, revealing molecular strategies that support xylem feeding, foam production, and environmental resilience. This comprehensive dataset not only advances the understanding of spittlebug biology but also identifies candidate molecular targets that may inform innovative strategies for controlling nymphal stages and mitigating spittlebug damage in forage systems.
